# shopping-list-mkr
A very simple and basic shopping list maker and handler in python

# Instuctions
In order to get the program to work you just need to have python installed (3.6+), then you just have to run the program typing `python shopping-list.py`

# Additional commands
By default the program takes recovers the data stored in the file `shoppingList.py` but you can override this behaviour using the additional command `--new True`
